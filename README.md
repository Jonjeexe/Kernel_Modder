## Kernel Modder
Normally the Linux kernel version string (shown in `uname -r` or `dmesg`) is set at compile time inside the kernel source. But if you donâ€™t want to rebuild the entire kernel, you can patch the binary kernel image after unpacking your boot.img.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Jonjeexe/Kernel_Modder && cd Kernel_Modder```
