## Kernel Modder
Normally the Linux kernel version string (shown in `uname -r` or `dmesg`) is set at compile time inside the kernel source. But if you donâ€™t want to rebuild the entire kernel, you can patch the binary kernel image after unpacking your boot.img.

## Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Jonjeexe/Kernel_Modder && cd Kernel_Modder && bash Setup.sh
```

## Now Start Modding
Enter Workplace folder
```
cd WORKPLACE && ls
```

## Unpack boot.img
Make sure your `boot.img` should be in internal storage but don't put in any folder that should be out of folders
and Termux has storage permission of do `termux-setup-storage`
```
chmod +x Tool
```
```
./Tool unpack /sdcard/boot.img
```
`Output`
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023df087-fd8d-40ea-82bc-8d43473c768a)

After unpack boot.img you will see.
- `kernel (the kernel binary)`
- `ramdisk.cpio (ramdisk)`
- `dtb (device tree, if present)`

Now we need `Kernel` file which is generated after unpack the boot.img
so we will search `Kernel version` 
## Find Kernel Version
```
strings kernel | grep "Linux version"
```
`Output`
```
~/Kernel_Modder/WORKPLACE $ strings kernel | grep "Linux version"
Linux version 4.19.127-perf-g7288046673d5 (builder@c4-xm-ota-bd022.bj) (Android (6443078 based on r383902) clang version 11.0.1 (https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project b397f81060ce6d701042b782172ed13bee898b79), LLD 11.0.1 (/buildbot/tmp/tmp6_m7QH b397f81060ce6d701042b782172ed13bee898b79)) #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jul 8 19:22:39 CST 2022
Linux version %s (%s)
```
## Replace with your custom version
```
sed -i 's/4.19.127-perf-g75/4.19.127-Jonjeexe/g' kernel

```
For example
sed -i 's/`Origanal Kernel version`/`Custom Kernel version`/g' kernel
